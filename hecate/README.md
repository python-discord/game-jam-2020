# Hecate

Hecate is a roguelike developed for the Python Discord's 2020 Game Jam. 

### Instructions

In Hecate, players are given 3 characters: a fighter, a rogue, and a wizard, 
to triumph against the infinite dungeon that they are trapped within. 
The player may explore the dungeon for better loot to increase the chances of survival.
For each floor a player descends, the dungeon grows more difficult.
There is no win condition; the goal is to survive as long as possible.

Your lifelong imprisonment in Hecate's inescapable labyrinth begins now.

### Setup

First, install dependencies through `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then, run the program through `python main.py`.
